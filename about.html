                <!-- I bold here the full name of the club: -->
                <b>Beitar Jerusalem Football Club</b>,
                commonly known as Beitar Jerusalem
                or simply as Beitar , is an Israeli
                football club based in the city of Jerusalem, that plays in
                the Israeli Premier League, the top tier in Israeli football.
                The club has traditionally worn kit colours of yellow and black.
                The team has played its home matches in Teddy Stadium.
                The stadium is the largest stadium in Israel with a capacity of 31,733.

                <!-- I underlined here an interesting fact about the club: -->
                <ins>The club is one of the most popular in Israel and is among the
                Israeli clubs with the highest number of fans in the country.</ins>
                The club was 
                <!-- I mark here the founding year of the club:-->
                <mark>founded in 1936</mark>  by Shmuel Kirschstein and David Horn,
                who chaired the Beitar branch in Jerusalem. Several team members were
                also part of the outlawed Irgun and Lehi militias closely associated
                with the right-wing Revisionist Zionism movement.
                Beitar's fans have become a highly controversial political symbol
                in Israeli football culture, unofficially aligned with the
                Revisionist Zionist movement and to the right-wing Likud party.</p>
